# Linear-Distribution-Flow
Optimal power flow in radial distribution grids

fLinDistFlow: Executes optimal power flow for a radial distribution system.

fStochLinDistFlow: Executes a stochastic optimal power flow for a radial distribution system.
The grid must contain at least two generators.
Generator at bus no.1 is considered to be the main station.
